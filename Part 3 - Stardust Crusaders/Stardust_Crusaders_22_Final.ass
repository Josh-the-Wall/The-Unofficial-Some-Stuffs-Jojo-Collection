Comment: 0,0:07:57.08,0:07:59.66,Main,Abdul,0,0,0,,T/N: Abdul here is communicating the idea that he is certain of his own existence and self. Although impossible to communicate in English, the phrase carries a weight of existentialism and solipsism that cannot adequately be expressed in a few short words. Abdul refutes the claim that one can only know of the existence of the universe through their own senses by inferring that his judgement is in an entirely separate metaphysical universe than Polnareff's, and thus not subject to the scrutiny of observable science as we now know it. This is compounded by his confident demeanor and fortune telling ability which gives him insights beyond what mere men will ever be able to comprehend. I can't think of anymore bullshit to write so this is filler text to fill up the entire screen. This scene is pretty fucking cool, isn't it? Too bad the way Abdul came back to life is pretty poorly written.
