Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.58,0:00:20.12,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,What is the purpose of living?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.58,0:00:23.71,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,To obtain one's desires.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.71,0:00:28.13,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Simply put, this is the purest reason there is to live.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.59,0:00:35.13,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,People want money, they want fame,\N they want food, they want to be loved, they want to make love...
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.39,0:00:42.98,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,But when a person attempts to obtain \Nwhat they desire, mustn't they fight for it, Enya?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.98,0:00:44.60,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Certainly.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.65,0:00:52.61,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,If that fight proves fruitless and they fail to obtain what they desire,\N a feeling of frustration and failure will overcome them.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.61,0:00:53.40,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,It is painful.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.32,0:00:58.91,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,And they will fear for the coming battles as a result.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.87,0:01:04.41,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,I believe that conquering fear is what it means to live.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.41,0:01:10.00,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,The one who will stand at the top of the world \Nis the one who feels no fear.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.67,0:01:17.84,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,I taught you well about your Stand and how to harness its power.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.84,0:01:20.43,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,What's more, you also possess an immortal body.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.43,0:01:23.68,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Is there something you fear? {Xemnas: Changed this line so the change to the next line flowed better.}
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.68,0:01:24.93,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,Possibly.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.23,0:01:27.94,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,What concerns you?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.94,0:01:30.48,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,The Joestar bloodline.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.48,0:01:36.03,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Joestar? Those two? They are mere filth.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.03,0:01:39.49,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Those fools are no match for your Stand!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.49,0:01:48.25,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,But when the lives of that filth are so deeply entangled \Nwith my own, I cannot help but believe it is destiny.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.88,0:01:50.38,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,To be more specific...
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.79,0:01:53.34,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,It is not that I fear the Joestars. {Xemnas: Nuance and all}
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.34,0:01:56.38,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,It is that I cannot take their bloodline lightly. {Xemnas, please check this line. I'm kind of just guessing based on context this is what he's saying, but the original line is really rough.} {Xemnas: Again nuance, and yeah this line was fine.}
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.13,0:02:03.39,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,I must remove the Joestars from the cogs of my destiny.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.47,0:02:10.69,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,You've decided to eliminate them yourself \Nsimply because you feel that they cannot be underestimated?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.69,0:02:11.52,Main,Dio,0,0,0,,Indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.52,0:02:12.77,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,Foolishness! {TALKING BACK TO THE GREAT DIO-SAMA YOU CRAZY OLD BITCH?!!?!!?}
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.77,0:02:17.28,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,You should never engage in such foolishness!
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.28,0:02:25.33,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,You have Empress, Hanged Man, Strength, \NWheel of Fortune, Temperance, Emperor, Devil...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.33,0:02:28.41,Main,Enya,0,0,0,,...and the Stand users who wield them to carry out your will!
