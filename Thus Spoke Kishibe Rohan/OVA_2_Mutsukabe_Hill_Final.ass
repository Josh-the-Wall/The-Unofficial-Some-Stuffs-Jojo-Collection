Comment: 0,0:05:35.18,0:05:36.48,Note,Naoko,0,0,0,,Note: This is an improper way to hold this controller. On top of the fact that this looks like a shitty MadCatz ripoff of a PlayStation controller rather than an actual SNES controller as would be appropriate for Gradius III, holding the controller in such a fashion makes you look like an absolute jackass. How on earth do you comfortably shift your right thumb to a different button? How do you hit L and R? You would get carpel tunnels in no time. No wonder Gunpei sucks at this game. {You think you know anything about video games, kiddo? Back in my day, we didn't complain about dumb shit like this as jokes in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure fansub scripts. We went face to fucking face and hashed it out like real men, but I guess that's too much for a 90's kid such as yourself. If it were up to me, people like you would be sent to camps where they were forced to play Desert Bus on repeat until they admit how bad their opinion of video games is. But unfortunately the world doesn't work that way, so I'll have to settle for totally fucking owning you in this note that wouldn't even be visible if the line weren't commented out. Anyway, that's enough from me. Keep living your miserable life you worthless piece of crap. -J} {Fight me irl fool you won't you can't because you SUCK. Deal with it. -A}
