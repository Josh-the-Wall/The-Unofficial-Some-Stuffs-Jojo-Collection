I think this is fine. Could take an alternate approach: "Sir, will you please use Heaven's Door to write "I can speak Italian" in/on me?" -Jules}{Went with a hybrid approach and used Toa's suggestion minus the "write into" part. Asking him to use Heaven's Door makes that information superfluous -J}

If anything, it'll match the JP word-for-word, but it's not a big deal if the phrase goes missing. -Jules}{Opted to leave it out since the line isn't on screen for long. Even though the "I'll tell you about" part is excluded, I don't think it's necessary since this phrasing implies that he's about to tell him about it anyway. -J}

Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.05,0:03:19.13,Thoughts,Rohan,0,0,0,,The deeper the secret, \N the more the heart agonizes and yearns to cry out.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.72,0:03:26.26,Thoughts,Rohan,0,0,0,,A confessional is where souls come to seek absolution, \N and embodies the knowledge of those who came before us.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.15,0:04:06.85,Main,Penitent,0,0,0,,Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. {Orig.: Bless me, Father, for I must confess. This sounds like a set phrase, so I'm going with the English equivalent. -Jules}

Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.90,0:04:51.64,Thoughts,Rohan,0,0,0,,It didn't really matter \N who listened to this man.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.64,0:04:58.40,Thoughts,Rohan,0,0,0,,Ultimately, it was more important that \N he believed he was confessing to a priest. {Added "that" -G}

Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.78,0:05:08.62,Main,Rohan,0,0,0,,I mean, please continue. {The idea here is that Rohan switches from insisting, informal Japanese to polite, formal Japanese.
