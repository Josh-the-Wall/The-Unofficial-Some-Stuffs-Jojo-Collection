The Japanese doesn't actually specify a subject, it's just "After Giorno was born, [SUBJECT] lived in Japan". -Starfish}{Seconded. - Toa} {This is a more a problem with the anime. The manga says she moved back to Japan to give birth to Giorno, not that they were living in Japan after his birth. Way to go, DP. -Axel}

There's no explicit insults in the original dialogue, but the TONE he says it in is fairly demeaning, so I figured this was what made the most sense. -Starfish} {Not sure about the racial slur.. -Axel}

Here, probably like: "That son of a... he's not hiding in someone's house, is he?" Also, guess this guy's a grunt because he's oddly polite here -JMFW}{Now I do love my line splits and I get the logic behind placing it where it is right now...
