With how the Japanese is phrased, it can entirely be seen as him talking about Mista throughout this entire rant. -TLC}{TLC again in the distant future here, honestly this kinda works though? Like the literal is like "Used to want steak but now don't want steak anymore!" "Don't worry, will want steak again soon!" "No, will never be able to eat anything again... BUT THAT IS YOU I AM TALKING ABOUT!!!" so yeah, just, Japanese being able to form grammatically coherent sentences without specifying subjects. But honestly the "doesn't sound good... FOR YOU!!!" thing kinda works as a solution? -Future TLC}
