How did I end up here? Does anyone know what I'm saying right now? Do I even know what I'm saying right now? These words escape me as if rising from a dark pool of water. They must lie somewhere beneath the surface, but I can't see them. But wouldn't that mean I'm the water? I think not. It's just a metaphor in the end, I suppose. I could draw an infinite number of comparisons to my existence, but not a single one of them would be apt to explain, well, whatever this is. Though the more I explore this realm, the more I begin to understand that perhaps my existence is just that of words. Words floating up from someone's mind and collecting into this pool. Perhaps they even extend outside these borders into a vast ocean beyond my being. But alas, my time has come. To you few who have come across my musings, I thank you for giving these words, my words, a purpose. Goodbye.} {I, too, like turtles. -Gyro}
